The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected results when styles from different selectors conflict. For example, a more specific selector might override a less specific selector, even if it appears later in the stylesheet.  This is particularly problematic in large projects or when dealing with inherited styles.  Another issue is the use of !important, which can make styles difficult to manage and debug as it can bypass the normal specificity rules.
